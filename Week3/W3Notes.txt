MIDDLEWARES






Global Catches - Helps you give the user better error messaage. If you don't use these your backend code might be visible to the enduser(client).
                 Which you don't want to happen bacuse they can read all that code and if there's any bug or vulnerability in your code they can 
                 manipulate your code. So to save ourselves from these hassels we use something call [Error Handling middleware]

Error Handling Middleware: This is a special type of middleware functionin Express that has four arguments instead of three (`(err, req, res, next)`). 
                            Express recognizes it as an error-handling middleware because of these four arguments.

Example Below - Looks like this and goes at the end of your code.

app.use(function(err, req, res, next){
    res.json({
        "Msg": "Sorry something is up with our server"
    });
});

How can you do better input Validation?
When you ask a user for input. He can send any input. For example for login if you are asking a user to create his id and password. User can just put anything into the 
id (input box - like here[adfkljdsjgoiajfg]) and if he send that back to the server it will be an error. Also situations where the user has to create need to create a 
strong password we see that it ask you that (password should be 8 digit, consist of numbers and alphabet charater and special charaters too.) These are the things we 
need to validate. To valdiate these input one thing we can do is create alot of IF/ELSE statment in your code. Which will be hectic or we can just use libraries Which
are build to made our life easy as a developer. One of those liberarires is Called ZOD.


ZOD - It lets you validata those input from the users which they sent back to your servers.
